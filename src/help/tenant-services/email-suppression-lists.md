# Email Suppression Lists

In order to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation, Data Protection Act and other laws, SCDS operates email suppression lists. These prevent users from receiving spam and protects the email sending reputation of SCDS and its domain names.

## Bounce Lists

Email addresses will be added to a block list if the email bounces and is not accepted by the recipient.

If an email address is added to the bounce list, no emails will be sent to that address again.

### Why do emails bounce?

Emails can bounce because of (but not limited to);

- The recipient domain does not exist
- The recipient mailbox does not exist
- The recipient's mailbox is full
- A block is applied at network level (e.g. a corporate policy on the recipient's domain)
- The recipient's provider blocked the content of the email (zip files can often be blocked)

## Complaints List

Email addresses can be automatically added to the complaints list if a user reports a message in their inbox as spam. This functionality is supported by most major email providers.

Email addresses are not added to the complaints list if the user's provider automatically classifies a message as spam, only if the user marks them as spam.

If an email address is added to the complaints list, no emails will be sent to that address again.

### Preventing complaints

To prevent complaints, a responsible club will almost never use the force send functionality provided to admins. Users should have opted in to any email they receive.

You must also prevent resending emails with the same or similar content. Sending of test emails via the membership system is forbidden.

SCDS regularly reviews the contents of emails sent through the notify function. Clubs or users may face suspension from the notify service if required to protect the sending reputation of SCDS.

### Reporting mail abuse

You can also report mail abuse directly to SCDS. In this case we will add your email to the complaints suppression list.

## Removal from suppression lists.

SCDS can only remove an email address from either list on request from the user themselves. Clubs can not make a request on behalf of a user.

To request removal, a user must send an email to [support@myswimmingclub.uk](mailto:support@myswimmingclub.uk), from the email address which they want removed.
