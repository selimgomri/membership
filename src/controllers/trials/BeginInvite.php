          You are about to invite <?=$parent['First']?> <?=$parent['Last']?> as a
          parent to join the club with their swimmers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <?=$parent['First']?> will receive an email from our system with
          instructions on how to set a password. All swimmers will be connected
          to the account automatically.

          Swimmers will only be added to our database when <?=$parent['First']?>
          sets up their user account. Swimmers will not appear on our systems
          until this is done.

        <h2>Review Swimmers</h2>
        <p>
          Please check that the swimmers listed below are the ones that you
          expect to be joining the club.

        <h2>Review Parent Email Address</h2>
        <p>
          Please check the email address for <?=$parent['First']?> is correct.
          It will be used to set up their account. If a user account already
          exists with the parent's email address, the swimmers will be added to
          that existing account.
